### Introduction

Determine the structure of Tensorflow programs and how ***Sessions*** and ***Graphs*** 
interact with eachother.

###### Graphs
* Used to define models
* Contains variables/constants
* Contains methods/actions to be used

###### Sessions
* Keep track of the assigned graph.
* Allows nodes in the graph to be run.
* Keeps track of node states and executions
